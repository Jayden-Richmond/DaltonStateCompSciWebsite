    <h4>Who are we?</h4>
    <p>We are the Computer Science Club at Dalton State. The club is full of students who are passionate about
        technology and the world of computer science. Most of us are going into jobs that relate to computer science,
        and so the club is there to offer a place for us to share ideas, and work together in computer science.</p>
